"The Beautiful Sangiovese!" 
This beautiful earworm was introduced to me when I was working as a harvest intern several years ago.
A ton or two of sangiovese grapes had come in late in the season (as they tend to do) and we got to work crushing and binning.
I had the nicecst handwriting of the team that harvest, so I was in charge of writing all the labels for bins and barrels on blue painter's tape.
The assistant winemaker pulled me aside and said, 

> :man: You have to label it :sparkles: The Beautiful Sangiovese :sparkles:  

That guy was on my last nerve that so close to the end of harvest, but I bit. 

> :woman: Do I want to know why? 

He then told me how a winemaker he'd worked with in the past called it that, and now he's passing the torch onto me.
Unfortunately, it worked all too well. 
I can't think of it any other way.

## TL;DR

Sangiovese is an historically Italian red wine grape that grows all over the world, and tends to make medium/light, highly tannic, and fruity/funky wine that pairs pretty dang great with food.
