# The Beautiful Sangiovese

## TL;DR

Sangiovese is an historically Italian red wine grape that grows all over the world, and tends to make medium/light, highly tannic, and fruity/funky wine that pairs pretty dang great with food. 

## Flavor Notes

Sangiovese is not typically overly fruity. Instead, folks tend to like Sangiovese if they like more savory flavors, like balsamic vinegar, Italian herbs, and coffee beans. 
That being said, the fruit flavors are present in the form of bright acids like underripe red cherries and tomato. 
There are many different styles of how to make a bottle of Sangiovese that largely depend on region typicality. 
Similarly to Pinot Noir, Sangiovese is often low- to medium-bodied. 
However, unlike Pinot Noir, Sangiovese can have quite the tannic punch. 
This trait is especially high-end bottles, but those are intended to age for many years, sometimes decades, to smooth out those tannins over time. 
Finally, the alcohol content is typically not very high, normally in the low 13%'s. 

## Location

Sangiovese is grown all over the world, but it is most famously an Italian grape. 
It is Italy's most grown wine grape.
As is true for most European winemaking conventions, it is more common to specify the place it is grown on the label, with the implicit connection of what grapes are grown there. 


If the bottle is Italian Sangiovese, then you may see it listed as:
- Chianti (with optional extra words like Classico, and many more)
- Montalcino (with optional prefixes like Brunello or Rosso)
- Vino Nobile di Montepulciano 
- Toscana
- Umbria
- Marche
- Lazio

The phrase "Super Tuscan" typically refers to a blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon and/or Merlot, although other grapes may be used.
The blend allowed by current regulations prohibits more than 30% of anything other than Sangiovese, although some classifications require 20% or 15%, depending on the regulation.
The label won't say "Super Tuscan" on it, so you'll have to do some independent research, but it will likely say Toscana, or if the wine is old enough Vino da Tavola, which will be a good starting place. 

After Italy, Sangiovese can be reliably sourced from Argentina, France, the United States, Tunisa, and Australia. 

## Chianti

The Sangiovese that is grown and produced in Chianti is arguably some of the most world-renowned wine made. 
Luxury Chianti can fetch thousands of dollars per bottle, and is often treated as an investment, not only for its typical aging period of decades, but for its resale or auction valuation. 
The most common designations you'll see for Chianti, and what their aging specifications are, include:
- Superiore (1 year aged minimum)
- Riserva (2 years aged minimum)
- Gran Selezione (2.5 years aged minimum)

The aging specification refers to how long the winery has to hold on to the bottled wine before being able to sell it. 

## Dorky Details

### Clones

Sangiovese has a number of common clones, some grouped in families:

- Sangiovese Grosso
  - Brunello
  - Prugnolo Gentile
  - Sangiovese di Lamole
- Sangiovese Piccolo
- R24
- T19

### Soil Types

Limestone is often regarded as the strongest soil type for growing high quality Sangiovese. 

### Harvest

Sangiovese is a very late harvest, often not being picked until October. 
Hot years produce higher quality traits in the grapes, like full flavor development and balancing alcohol levels, whereas cool years can produce too-strong acidity and tannins. 
If the grape is overproduced, the acid can be too high, and is at risk of early oxidization. 

### Grape Anatomy

Sangiovese has a relatively thin skin, which makes it vulnerable to rot on the vine.

## Barely Necessary Fun Facts

- The literal translation of Sangiovese is "blood of Jove," which supports the idea that Sangiovese is one of the oldest varietals dating thousands of years.
